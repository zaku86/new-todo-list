# Todo List App

Our todo list app would have 5 components

- App.jsx
  - TodoHeader.jsx
  - TodoBody.jsx
    - Todo.jsx
    - Button.jsx

## Instructions

- Go ahead and create all those five components and render them accordingly
  meaning put the components in their right positions
- Setup your styling and style the app to have the bg color and also style the header
  component
- Create a dummy data that holds an array of 10 to 15 todos, use the data and react
  lists to render the list of todos in the todoBody component.
  Make sure you fix styling issues like overflowing and make sure you jdon't have any
  erros on the console
- Conditionally render styling on the todo icon and paragraph so that we have
  a diffefrent icon when the task is completed and the text decoration should be line through for tasks that are completed as well. use React conditioning to achieve this
